** Development Requirements
- Python 3
- [[https://docs.pipenv.org/][Pipenv]]
- Pipfile dependencies

To install the Pipfile dependencies just run the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ pipenv install
#+END_SRC

You should also have the site's theme in the correct location and should adjust the plugin settings
if you want to build the site. These configurations are near the bottom of pelicanconf.py and look
like this:

#+NAME: pelicanconf.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python
USER_THEME_PATH = expanduser(join('local', 'path', 'to', 'themes'))
THEME_NAME = 'site_theme'
THEME = join(USER_THEME_PATH, THEME_NAME)

PLUGIN_PATHS = [expanduser(join('local', 'path', 'to', 'plugins')), ...]
ORG_READER_EMACS_LOCATION = ('/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs' if SYSTEM == 'Darwin'
                             else '/usr/bin/emacs')
#+END_SRC

So modify your USER_THEME_PATH (/local/path/to/themes/ in the example) and PLUGIN_PATHS
(/local/path/to/plugins/, etc.) so they point to your local pelican directories. If you don't
have any of these, you should clone [[https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes][the pelican themes]] and [[https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins][the pelican plugins]] repositories and use
those directories.

These configurations are near the bottom of pelicanconf.py and look like this:

#+NAME: pelicanconf.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python
USER_THEME_PATH = expanduser(join('local, path', 'to', 'theme'))
THEME_NAME = 'site_theme'
THEME = join(USER_THEME_PATH, THEME_NAME)

PLUGIN_PATHS = [expanduser(join('~', 'g', 'pelican-plugins'))]
ORG_READER_EMACS_LOCATION = ('/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs' if SYSTEM == 'Darwin'
                             else '/usr/bin/emacs')
#+END_SRC

So place the theme specified by THEME_NAME (/site_theme/ in the example) in USER_THEME_PATH
(/local/path/to/theme/) and modify PLUGIN_PATHS or any other setting if necessary
